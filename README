So, with the insanity at play with my creations, ive made a running, working minecraft instance compatible with the PBP. I custom compiled lwjgl and set the work environments properly as to allow players to run it.

You need Panfrost to run it, but someone may try to get it running with the Mali driver.


WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:

1.) Make a directory in your home called .minecraft, then inside that directory, make another one called natives.

2.) Copy the library files from the Libraries folder to the natives directory you just made

3.) Install Java(kind of a given at this point :P )

4.) Edit the runMC.sh script to point to your home directory 
(im sorry, I couldnt figure out how to get it to autodetect and use $USER :P )

5.) Run runMC.sh

6.) Run the Optifine installer(Not required but highly recommended for smooth gameplay)

6.) Have fun tweaking and tinkering :)



THE ONLY TESTED WORKING VERSION I USED WAS 1.12.2, IT MAY OR MAY NOT WORK ON NEWER VERSIONS DUE TO OPENGL3 DEPENDENCY


notes:

1.) LWJGL was easy, MultiMC, on the other hand, not so much. Thats one reason why i tested with Mineshafter the majority of the time. MultiMC doesnt seem to like standard pointing calls to specific libraries and instead ignores them for its own.

2.) I dont condone piracy at all, but unfortunately the only way ive figured out how to get it working is to use Mineshafter, you may be able to get a official client running but so far i havent because of the library hack.
